![Main FRICOSIPY developer](images/FRICOSIPY-model-developer.jpg){style="float: right; width: 350px; margin-left: 20px;"}

The *FRICOSIPY* model is currently solely developed by myself, *Marcus Gastaldello*, a PhD student at the *Department of Geosciences*, *University of Fribourg*, *Switzerland*. 

Please report any bugs found with the code directly to the [issues page on *GitHub*](https://github.com/MarcusGastaldello/FRICOSIPY/issues), clearly indicating the code lines and the error message.

If you interested in collaboration, have suggestions to improve the model or our having difficulties understanding the documentation, please feel free to get in touch:
