# Introduction

**FRICOSIPY** (The University of **FRI**bourg variant of the **CO**upled **S**now & **I**ce Model in **PY**thon) is a 1-dimensonal, coupled surface energy balance and
multi-layer subsurface firn model that evaluates the mass balance of a glacier.

FRICOSIPY has been developed as an adapation of the original [COSIPY](https://github.com/cryotools/cosipy) v1.4 model of [Sauter et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-5645-2020) and is designed to enhance the modelling of subsurface firn processes and enable greater accessibility for users with limited computational resources - principally by restructuring the core design to greatly improve memory/RAM optimisation.

The latest version of FRICOSIPY is available at: [https://github.com/MarcusGastaldello/FRICOSIPY](https://github.com/MarcusGastaldello/FRICOSIPY).
