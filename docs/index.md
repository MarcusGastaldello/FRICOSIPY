# Introduction

**FRICOSIPY** is a variant of the Coupled Snow & Ice Model in Python [(COSIPY)](https://github.com/cryotools/cosipy) developed at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland. FRICOSIPY enhances the modelling of subsurface firn processes and enables greater accessibility for users with limited computational resources by restructuring the core design to greatly improve memory/RAM optimisation.

The latest version of FRICOSIPY is available at: [https://github.com/MarcusGastaldello/FRICOSIPY](https://github.com/MarcusGastaldello/FRICOSIPY).
