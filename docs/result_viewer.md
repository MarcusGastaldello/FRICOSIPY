# Result Viewer

The *FRICOSIPY* result viewer is a *Jupyter Notebook* interactive workbook that contains a few plotting functions to help visualise results of the model. It is designed to provide a few examples of how to manipulate Network Common Data Format (NetCDF) files using the *Xarray* python computing package and provide greater accessibility to those less familiar with programming.
