# Model Input Files

The FRICOSIPY model requires three input Network Common Data Format (NetCDF) files in order to run a simulation: Static, Meteo and Illumination. These replace the large 3-dimensional input dataset ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) of the original COSIPY model in order to lessen the required computational resources and enable the running of a simulation with a high spatio-temporal resolution.

## Static

## Meteo

## Illumination
